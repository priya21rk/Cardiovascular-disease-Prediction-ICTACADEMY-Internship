# CVD Project: Machine Learning and AI for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
The **CVD Project** aims to leverage machine learning and AI techniques to analyze cardiovascular health data and predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in individuals. This project involves data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model.

## Features
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and normalizes features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selects and transforms relevant features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Experiments with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure optimal performance.
5. **Prediction**: Makes predictions on new patient data to assess CVD risk.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various cardiovascular health indicators, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Glucose Levels
- Smoking Status
- Physical Activity Level
- Medical History Indicators

> **Note**: Please ensure compliance with data privacy and protection guidelines when handling the data.
