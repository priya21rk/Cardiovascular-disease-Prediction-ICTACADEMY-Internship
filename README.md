#CVD Project: Machine Learning and AI for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

#Project Overview:

The CVD Project aims to leverage machine learning and AI techniques to analyze cardiovascular health data and predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in individuals. This project involves data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model.

#Features

1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing features.

2.Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to improve model performance.

3.Model Training: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, SVM.

4.Model Evaluation: Evaluating models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure optimal performance.

5.Prediction: Making predictions on new patient data to assess CVD risk.

#Dataset:

The dataset used in this project includes various cardiovascular health indicators like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, lifestyle factors, and medical history. Please ensure compliance with data privacy and protection guidelines when handling the data.
